Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a structured space for studying, documenting, and practicing requirement analysis in software development.
It covers foundational concepts, real-world examples, templates, and practical exercises that help developers, analysts, and product designers understand how to gather, interpret, document, and validate software requirements effectively.

What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis plays a foundational role in shaping successful software projects. It ensures that every stakeholder—from developers to clients—shares the same understanding of what the system should achieve. Its importance can be seen in the following ways:

1. Prevents Misunderstanding and Scope Creep

Clear requirements reduce ambiguity and ensure that project goals are well defined. This helps avoid sudden changes, unclear expectations, and unnecessary additions that can derail timelines and budgets.

2. Saves Time, Cost, and Resources

Identifying user needs early helps teams make accurate estimations and avoid rework. When requirements are validated upfront, development becomes more efficient, reducing wasted effort and financial losses.

3. Improves Product Quality and User Satisfaction

A well-analyzed requirement set leads to solutions that align with user needs. This ensures that the final product performs as intended, meets usability expectations, and delivers meaningful value to its end users.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The requirement analysis process involves several core activities that help teams understand what a system must achieve and how it should function. These activities ensure clarity, alignment, and a strong foundation for the entire development lifecycle.

Requirement Gathering
Collecting initial information from stakeholders, users, and existing systems to understand the needs, expectations, and challenges the new system must address.

Requirement Elicitation
Using techniques such as interviews, workshops, surveys, observations, and brainstorming to uncover deeper insights, clarify user needs, and identify hidden or unstated requirements.

Requirement Documentation
Organizing and recording all collected requirements in structured formats such as SRS documents, user stories, use cases, or functional requirement specifications for clear communication and reference.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Examining requirements for completeness, feasibility, consistency, and priority. This often involves creating models like diagrams, workflows, prototypes, and user journey maps to visualize system behavior.

Requirement Validation
Reviewing and verifying requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and alignment. This confirms that the documented requirements truly represent business needs and are ready for implementation.

Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements

Definition: Functional requirements describe what the system must do — the specific behaviours, features, and interactions that fulfil the user’s needs.
Examples (for a booking-management system like the one in the case study):

The system shall allow a user to search for available hotel rooms by location, date range, number of guests.

The system shall allow the user to select a hotel room and proceed to booking with payment integration.

The system shall send a booking confirmation notification (email or push) to the user and hotel manager after a successful booking.

The system shall allow the hotel manager to update room availability and pricing via a management portal.

Non-functional Requirements

Definition: Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs its functions — these include qualities such as performance, reliability, usability, and maintainability.
Examples (for the same booking-management system):

The system shall respond to search queries within 2 seconds under a normal load.

The system shall be available 99.9% of the time (excluding scheduled maintenance).

The booking service shall scale horizontally to handle at least 10,000 concurrent bookings per minute during peak traffic.

The system shall support modern web browsers and mobile devices (iOS and Android) with consistent user experience.

Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent how different users (actors) interact with a system. They highlight the major functions the system must support and provide a high-level understanding of user goals.
These diagrams help teams clarify system behavior, identify missing requirements, and align stakeholders around how the system should work.

Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

Provide a clear, visual understanding of system interactions

Help identify key functional requirements early

Improve communication between developers, designers, and stakeholders

Serve as a foundation for creating user stories, test cases, and workflows

Highlight roles and responsibilities across various actors
